Here we present GreenDB, a database that collects products from European online shops on a weekly basis. As proxy for the products’ sustainability, it relies on sustainability labels, which are evaluated by experts. The GreenDB schema extends the well-known schema.org Product definition and can be readily integrated into existing product catalogs to improve sustainability information available for search and recommendation experiences.

The GreenDB enables the implementation of applications such as the prototypical Chrome Extension [*Koala - Ecosia Assistant Beta - Grün shoppen*](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/koala-ecosia-assistant-be/anhndceoafjjdihnjnpojdihgboocgpa), which we built as part of the GCA project. The Koala detects when and what users would like to buy online and offers more sustainable alternatives. More information can be found in [one of our working papers](https://green-consumption-assistant.de/wp-content/uploads/GCA-Working-Paper-I-Scaling-Sustainability-Advice.pdf).
